## üåü Why SMS Spam Detector?

Tired of sifting through suspicious SMS messages?  
**SMS Spam Detector** leverages pre-trained machine learning models to instantly classify SMS text as **Spam** or **Ham (Not Spam)**. Whether you're testing models, analyzing message logs, or just curious, this tool provides:

- üöÄ **Fast Classification** using optimized ML models.
- ü§ñ **Multiple Model Options** ‚Äì Compare results from different algorithms (Ensemble, SVM, Logistic Regression).
- üìù **Clean Text Preprocessing** ‚Äì Ensures accurate predictions by mirroring training data preparation.
- üé≤ **Built-in SMS Generator** ‚Äì Quickly test the classifier with realistic Ham or Spam examples.
- üß† **Confidence Scores** ‚Äì Understand the model's certainty behind each prediction.
- üñ•Ô∏è **Simple Web Interface** ‚Äì Easy-to-use UI built with Streamlit, deployable locally or on servers.

Ideal for:
- Data Scientists üß™
- Developers üë®‚Äçüíª
- Students üìö
- Anyone interested in NLP and ML applications ü§ñ

## üìä Performance Comparison

We evaluated the core models on a held-out test set to provide a performance benchmark.

| Model                       | Accuracy | Precision (Spam) | Recall (Spam) | F1-Score (Spam) | AUC-ROC |
| :-------------------------- | :------: | :--------------: | :-----------: | :-------------: | :-----: |
| **Hybrid Ensemble Model**   | 0.9848   | 0.9688           | 0.9262        | 0.9470          | 0.9890  |
| Tuned Logistic Regression   | 0.9848   | 0.9583           | 0.9262        | 0.9420          | 0.9872  |
| Tuned Linear SVM            | 0.9848   | 0.9853           | 0.8993        | 0.9404          | 0.9883  |

> **Note:** The Hybrid Ensemble Model combines the strengths of multiple algorithms, resulting in the highest overall performance and robustness for this task.
